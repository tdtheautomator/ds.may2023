LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible interface between your external data and LLMs. It provides the following tools in an easy-to-use fashion: Offers data connectors to your existing data sources and data formats (API's, PDF's, docs, SQL, etc.) Provides indices over your unstructured and structured data for use with LLM's.

At its core, LlamaIndex contains a toolkit designed to easily connect LLM’s with your external data. LlamaIndex helps to provide the following:
- A set of data structures that allow you to index your data for various LLM tasks, and remove concerns over prompt size limitations.
- Data connectors to your common data sources (Google Docs, Slack, etc.).
- Cost transparency + tools that reduce cost while increasing performance.
Each data structure offers distinct use cases and a variety of customizable parameters. These indices can then be queried in a general purpose manner, in order to achieve any task that you would typically achieve with an LLM:
- Question-Answering
- Summarization
- Text Generation (Stories, TODO’s, emails, etc.)
